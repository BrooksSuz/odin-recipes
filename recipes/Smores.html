    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      S'mores are a personal favorite of mine. They are a simple dessert containing toasted marshmellow with small bars of chocolate sandwiched between a pair of graham crackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They're simple to make and incredibly delicious. They're most commonly enjoyed while camping! 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1x Marshmellow
      </li>
      <li>
        1x Chocolate Bar
      </li>
      <li>
        1x Graham Cracker
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grab a graham cracker and break it into two halves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break off 1-3 squares of chocolate from a chocolate bar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up marshmellow until golden brown and add it to your graham crackers. Any common heating source will do just fine if you aren't sitting next to a campfire.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top your S'more off with the other half of the graham cracker and give light pressure to the sandwich. This will spread the marshmellow evenly and melt the chocolate.
      </li>
    </ol>
